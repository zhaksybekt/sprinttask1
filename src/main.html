        <h2>Khabib had a similar beef with Conor McGregor, how did he handle it?</h2>
        <p>You all know what happened, those images of Conor throwing that dolly on a bus and injuring fighters from Khabib's team set the stage for a great fight. In similar fashion, Conor spoke ill abour Khabib's father and he even insulted the man's religion. This is what made Numagomedov's blood boil and he eventually got his revenge. However, he controlled himself by not taking matters in his own hands outside of the octagon like Conor did. Khabib disapproves of what Covington is doing right now and he didn't hesitate to point it out through one of his tweets. He even went further by suggesting all UFC fighters should turn their backs on Colby for a potential fight. Covington violated those unwritten rules inside the UFC about messing with family.</p>
